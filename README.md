# CARE-360

# Overview

Users will be able to maintain their medical records, monitor their progress over time, and share their medical history with doctors while they're on the move thanks to this web application. It will make use of augmented reality (AR) to visualise procedures that have been carried out and machine learning (ML) to provide insights into the user's health data.

# Features

The web application will include the following features:

- __Secure storage of healthcare records__: Users will be able to securely store their healthcare records in the cloud, including medical history, lab results, and imaging reports.

- __ML-powered insights__: It will use ML to provide users with insights into their health data, such as identifying trends and patterns, and predicting future health risks.

- __AR visualization of implemented surgeries__: It will also use AR to provide users with a visualization of their implemented surgeries, which can help them to understand the procedure and its aftermath.

- __Ability to share medical history with doctors__: Users will be able to easily share their medical history with doctors on the go, which can help to improve the quality of care they receive.

# Use Cases

- __*Patients*__: Patients can use it to manage their healthcare records, track their progress over time, and share their medical history with doctors on the go.

- __*Doctors*__: Doctors can use it to access their patients' medical history and insights, which can help them to provide better care.

- __*Researchers*__: Researchers can use this to access a large dataset of healthcare records, which can be used to develop new medical treatments and diagnostic tools.

# Benefits

- __Improved healthcare outcomes__: This project can help to improve healthcare outcomes by providing patients with a way to better manage their health and by providing doctors with access to their patients' medical history and insights.

- __Reduced healthcare costs__: It can help to reduce healthcare costs by making it easier for patients to share their medical history with doctors and by helping doctors to provide better care.

- __Empowered patients__: Also, it can help to empower patients by giving them more control over their healthcare data and by providing them with insights into their health.
